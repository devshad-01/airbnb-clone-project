# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack web application designed to simulate the functionality of Airbnb. This project aims to provide a platform for users to discover, book, and review properties worldwide. The backend will be built with Django and utilize MySQL for data storage, while implementing modern development practices like CI/CD pipelines and API security measures.

## Team Roles

### Backend Developer
Responsible for developing the server-side logic, API endpoints, and integrating with the database.

### Database Administrator
Designs and maintains the database schema, ensures data integrity, and optimizes query performance.

### DevOps Engineer
Sets up and maintains the CI/CD pipeline, deployment infrastructure, and monitoring systems.

### Security Engineer
Implements authentication, authorization, and other security measures to protect the application.

### Product Manager
Defines features, prioritizes tasks, and ensures the project aligns with business goals.

## Technology Stack

### Django
A high-level Python web framework for rapid development and clean design of backend APIs.

### MySQL
A relational database management system for storing structured data like users, properties, and bookings.

### GraphQL
A query language for APIs that enables clients to request exactly the data they need.

### Docker
A platform for containerizing applications to ensure consistency across development and production environments.

### GitHub Actions
A CI/CD tool for automating build, test, and deployment workflows.

## Database Design

### Users
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `username`
- `email`
- `password_hash`
- `created_at`

### Properties
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `owner_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
- `title`
- `description`
- `price_per_night`

### Bookings
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key to Properties)
- `guest_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
- `check_in_date`
- `check_out_date`
- `total_price`

### Reviews
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key to Properties)
- `author_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
- `rating`
- `comment`
- `created_at`

**Relationships:**
- A User can own multiple Properties (One-to-Many)
- A Property can have multiple Bookings (One-to-Many)
- A Property can have multiple Reviews (One-to-Many)
- A User can make multiple Bookings (One-to-Many)
- A User can write multiple Reviews (One-to-Many)

## Feature Breakdown

### User Management
Allows users to register, login, and manage their profiles. Essential for personalization and security.

### Property Management
Enables property owners to list, update, and manage their rental properties with details and photos.

### Booking System
Facilitates the reservation process with date selection, pricing calculation, and confirmation.

### Review System
Allows guests to leave ratings and feedback for properties they've stayed at.

### Search and Filtering
Helps users find properties based on location, price, amenities, and availability.

## API Security

### Authentication
JWT tokens will be used to verify user identity and maintain secure sessions.

### Authorization
Role-based access control ensures users can only access resources they have permission for.

### Rate Limiting
Prevents abuse by limiting how often API endpoints can be called within a time period.

### Data Validation
All input will be sanitized and validated to prevent injection attacks.

### HTTPS
All communications will be encrypted in transit using TLS/SSL certificates.

## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the process of testing and deploying code changes. This ensures that new features and bug fixes can be delivered quickly and reliably.

**Tools we'll use:**
- GitHub Actions for running automated tests on every commit
- Docker for containerizing the application for consistent environments
- Automated deployment to staging and production environments

**Pipeline steps:**
1. Code linting and style checking
2. Unit and integration testing
3. Building Docker images
4. Deployment to test environments
5. Manual approval for production deployment
