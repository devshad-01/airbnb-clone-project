# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview

The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack web application designed to simulate the functionality of Airbnb. This project aims to provide a platform for users to discover, book, and review properties worldwide. The backend will be built with Django and utilize PostgreSQL for data storage, while implementing modern development practices like CI/CD pipelines and API security measures.

## üöÄ Objective

The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

## üèÜ Project Goals

- **User Management**: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- **Property Management**: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
- **Booking System**: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
- **Payment Processing**: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
- **Review System**: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
- **Data Optimization**: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack

### Django

A high-level Python web framework for rapid development and clean design of backend APIs.

### Django REST Framework

Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.

### PostgreSQL

A powerful relational database used for data storage for users, properties, bookings, and other structured data.

### GraphQL

A query language for APIs that enables clients to request exactly the data they need.

### Celery

For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.

### Redis

Used for caching and session management.

## Database Design

### Users

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `username`
- `email`
- `password_hash`
- `created_at`

### Properties

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `owner_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
- `title`
- `description`
- `price_per_night`

### Bookings

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key to Properties)
- `guest_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
- `check_in_date`
- `check_out_date`
- `total_price`

### Reviews

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key to Properties)
- `author_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
- `rating`
- `comment`
- `created_at`

**Relationships:**

- A User can own multiple Properties (One-to-Many)
- A Property can have multiple Bookings (One-to-Many)
- A Property can have multiple Reviews (One-to-Many)
- A User can make multiple Bookings (One-to-Many)
- A User can write multiple Reviews (One-to-Many)

## Feature Breakdown

### User Management

Allows users to register, login, and manage their profiles. Essential for personalization and security.

### Property Management

Enables property owners to list, update, and manage their rental properties with details and photos.

### Booking System

Facilitates the reservation process with date selection, pricing calculation, and confirmation.

### Review System

Allows guests to leave ratings and feedback for properties they've stayed at.

### Search and Filtering

Helps users find properties based on location, price, amenities, and availability.

## API Security

### Authentication

JWT tokens will be used to verify user identity and maintain secure sessions.

### Authorization

Role-based access control ensures users can only access resources they have permission for.

### Rate Limiting

Prevents abuse by limiting how often API endpoints can be called within a time period.

### Data Validation

All input will be sanitized and validated to prevent injection attacks.

### HTTPS

All communications will be encrypted in transit using TLS/SSL certificates.

## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the process of testing and deploying code changes. This ensures that new features and bug fixes can be delivered quickly and reliably.

**Tools we'll use:**

- GitHub Actions for running automated tests on every commit
- Docker for containerizing the application for consistent environments
- Automated deployment to staging and production environments

**Pipeline steps:**

1. Code linting and style checking
2. Unit and integration testing
3. Building Docker images
4. Deployment to test environments
5. Manual approval for production deployment
